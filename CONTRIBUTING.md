We will always have a need for developers to help us improve RailsAPI. If you are a developer and are interested in helping then please do not hesitate. Just make sure you follow our guidelines.

Overall, our guidelines strongly follow those of [Google's Java Style Guidelines](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) with a few modifications.

A more in-depth guideline can be found in our [implementation guidelines](https://github.com/PoweredRails/Rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
